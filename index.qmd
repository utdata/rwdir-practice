## My upper dating age

The following section details the [socially-acceptable maximum age of anyone you should date](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/meet-catch-and-keep/201405/who-is-too-young-or-too-old-you-date).

The math works like this:

- Take your age
- subtract 7
- Double the result

```{r}
# update 21 to your actual age
age <- 21
(age - 7) * 2
```

## Lower dating age

```{r}
# Using age variable from above
(age / 2) + 7
```
